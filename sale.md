> To make a purchase on the Twitch Service, you must be a registered Twitch Service user and comply with these Terms of Sale (including the [Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service). You acknowledge that you are responsible for maintaining the security of, and restricting access to, your account and password, and you agree to accept responsibility for all purchases and other activities that occur under your account.

Subscription Services may renew automatically, with payment due prior to each renewal. You agree to pay your subscription fee in advance of receiving any such Subscription Service. Twitch reserves the right to discontinue or modify any subscription fee payment option. If we discontinue or modify a subscription payment option, we will provide notice of such discontinuance or modification. You must affirmatively consent to the new payment terms in order to continue receiving the Subscription Services. If you do not affirmatively consent, your subscription will be cancelled. Also, if you are signing up under any promotional subscription fee, some additional restrictions may apply. These restrictions, if any, will be provided to you before you sign up for the applicable Subscription Service that is subject to the promotion.
>
> You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account. Twitch reserves the right to deactivate Subscription Services to your account if payment is past due, regardless of the dollar amount.
>
> #### Subscription Service - Automatic Payments
>
> If you choose a Subscription Service (including any pre-paid subscription option, gift subscriptions, or channel subscriptions which reverts to a monthly payment plan at the expiration of the pre-paid period), you hereby grant Twitch permission to automatically charge the subscription fee to your chosen payment method at the beginning of each applicable payment period. Your access, or the gift recipient's access, to the Subscription Services will not be established until Twitch has verified that the credit card or other payment information you provide Twitch for payment is accurate and that your payment method account is in good standing.
>
> You further agree that Twitch may charge any other applicable fees for the Twitch Service or Ancillary Products and Services, if disclosed to you in connection with your purchase, to your payment method, including any early termination fee.
>
> You are required to keep your billing information current, complete and accurate (for example, if you move, be sure to update your billing address, if you get a new credit/debit card, make sure you update the card number and/or expiration date) and notify Twitch if your selected payment method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft).
>
> Twitch reserves the right to suspend or terminate your access to any Subscription Service that is a part of the Twitch Service without notice upon rejection of any charges or if your payment method (or its agent or affiliate) seeks return of payments previously made to Twitch when Twitch believes you are liable for the charges.
>
> #### Cancellation of Subscription Services
>
> You may choose not to renew your Subscription Service at any time.
>
> For Subscriptions Services, you may choose to not renew by selecting the "Do Not Renew" option under your subscription settings in the relevant Twitch Service or by contacting customer support via e-mail (e.g., <purchasesupport@twitch.tv>).
>
> Your cancellation is effective at the end of the current subscription term.

> #### Bits
>
> The Ancillary Products and Services that Twitch may offer, on a promotional basis or for purchase, may include Bits, which are digital content (_i.e._, animated emoticons) that allow users to celebrate moments and express appreciation for specific broadcasters using the cheering feature ("**Cheering**") on the Twitch Service ("**Bits**"). Users may also use Bits in Extensions (as defined below) to obtain other digital items or experiences. The Ancillary Products and Services may also include certain Twitch rewards or benefits provided to Users of Bits ("**Rewards**"). Your use of Bits or Rewards is subject to the Terms of Service, including the Bits Acceptable Use Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference.
>
> Korea Only:  You may not use more more than 10,000 Bits per emote and may not use more than 250,000 Bits per message.
>
> Bits and Rewards have no monetary value (_i.e._, are not a cash account or equivalent), and do not constitute currency or property of any type. Bits and Rewards cannot be sold or transferred to other Users, and cannot be exchanged for cash or for any other goods and services. Users have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, or monetary interest in promotional or purchased Bits, which remain Twitch digital content subject to the Twitch Terms of Service, or in Rewards. Except as required by applicable law in your jurisdiction, Bits are non-refundable. Bits that are used for Cheering, or in Extensions for digital items or experiences, will not be returned. We do not recognize the transfer of Bits or Rewards (including for money or any other consideration or items of value whether inside or outside of the Twitch Service). Accordingly, you may not purchase, sell, barter, or trade any Bits or Rewards, or offer to purchase, sell, or trade any Bits or Rewards. Any such attempted transfer will be null and void.
>
> Although Twitch may share revenue generated from the sale of Bits with the broadcaster or an Extension developer receiving the Bits subject to the agreement solely between Twitch and the broadcaster or developer as the case may be, Bits are not intended to be used as a means to provide financial support to the broadcaster or developer, and Twitch makes no assurances to any User that any broadcaster or Extension developer receiving Bits will receive a revenue share.
>
> Twitch does not guarantee that Bits or Rewards will be available at all times or at any given time. Twitch does not guarantee that we will continue to offer Bits or Rewards for any particular length of time. Twitch may modify Bits or Rewards at our sole discretion, and such modifications may make Bits or Rewards more or less common, desirable, effective, or functional. Twitch may immediately suspend or terminate Bits or Rewards for any or no reason, in our sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. The number of Bits required to be used to earn Rewards may be substantially increased, any Reward may be withdrawn, and restrictions on any Reward or Reward redemption may be imposed at any time, even though such changes may affect the value or utility of Bits or Rewards, or the ability to obtain certain Rewards. In accumulating Bits, Users may not rely upon the continued availability of any Reward or Reward level, category or tier.
>
> Twitch reserves the right to change and update our inventory of Bits without notice. Twitch reserves all right, title and interest in Bits and Bits inventories, and all associated copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein. Except as required by applicable law, any unused Bits inventory will be forfeited to Twitch upon termination of your Twitch account.
>
> Twitch reserves the right to deactivate a User from any Twitch service for any reason or no reason. Once a User has been deactivated, any Bits or Rewards accumulated by that User will be forfeited and may not be reinstated.
>
> Korea Only:  You have the right to cancel your purchase and obtain a refund within seven days from the date of the purchase, provided that you have not used any of the Bits purchased in this transaction, at which point Twitch will deduct the purchased Bits from your account. Your purchase cannot be cancelled, irrespective of the date of the purchase, if you have used any of the Bits purchased in a transaction.
>
> Korea Only:  Purchases made by a minor may be cancelled by the minor or the minor's parent or legal guardian in case the parent or legal representative does not consent to the purchase made by the minor.

Any information you provide to the third party will be subject to that third party's privacy policy or similar terms, and will not be subject to the Amazon Privacy Notice or Twitch Privacy Notice.

> #### Twitch Extensions
>
> Ancillary Products and Services that Twitch may offer include certain digital goods sold via the [Twitch Extensions](https://dev.twitch.tv/extensions) program. This program allows broadcasters to embed interactive, custom, third-party content and applications on their channel pages, through which such items may be purchased by Users.
>
> Twitch does not guarantee that Extension developers will continue to offer any particular digital goods, or that broadcasters will keep particular Extensions active on their channel pages, for a minimum length of time. Developers may modify the digital goods made available in their Extensions, and Twitch may change its policies for what categories of items may be made available in connection with the Twitch Extensions program. Extension developers may deprecate or significantly change their Extensions over time. Twitch does not guarantee any level of availability for Extensions, which may experience periods of unavailability from time to time. Twitch may immediately suspend or take down Extensions that violate our terms and policies in our sole discretion. The foregoing events may occur without advance notice or liability and make the items you have purchased unavailable or less common, desirable, effective, or functional.
>
> You acknowledge and agree that the price for digital goods sold through Twitch Extensions may change at any time without notice, for any reason or for no reason.
>
> Twitch may subsequently make digital goods that you have purchased usable on the Twitch Services only and prohibit use thereof on third-party services or websites.

> Your use of any digital goods is subject to the Twitch Terms of Service and any applicable end user license terms of the relevant Extension developer. You can find out more about the specific Extension(s) operating on a given channel, including end user license terms, by clicking on the attribution links or icons that Twitch will make available on the channel page, for example, on the Twitch video player or at the bottom of an Extension's panel.

Any purchased items remaining in your account at the time of termination will be forfeited and no compensation will be provided.
>
> #### Refund Policy
>
> When you make or receive the gift of a purchase on the Twitch Service, including in third-party Extensions, you have immediate access to, and use of, the Ancillary Products and Services you have purchased. Accordingly, except as detailed in these Terms of Sale, you lose your right to cancel once you have made your purchase, and we do not offer any refunds or credits, including, without limitation, fees for Subscription Services. Twitch reserves the right to modify this refund policy as set forth below at any time.

You are bound by such third-party legal terms and we encourage you to read them.
>
> #### Delivery
>
> With respect to Ancillary Products and Services you purchase in connection with the Twitch Service, you acknowledge and agree that upon making such Ancillary Products and Services available to you (or to their intended authorized recipients), Twitch will have fully satisfied its obligation to deliver or otherwise provide such products, services or digital content, regardless of any failure or inability to use such products, services or digital content.

> #### Service Descriptions and Availability, Errors
>
> Twitch and its suppliers and licensors continually upgrade and revise the Twitch Service to provide you with new Ancillary Products and Services. Twitch may revise, discontinue or modify Ancillary Products and Services at any time without prior notice to you, and Ancillary Products and Services may become unavailable without notice. Twitch shall have no liability of any kind if an Ancillary Service that has been ordered is unavailable. If necessary, Twitch reserves the right to cancel an order or substitute an Ancillary Product or Service of equal or greater value when a product, service or digital content is unavailable. For example, for pre-paid purchases of multi-month channel subscriptions using Xsolla, in the event a channel stops being available, Twitch is unable to offer you a refund but, upon request, will upgrade you to a Turbo subscription for the number of months remaining on your original subscription.
>
> We attempt to be as accurate as possible and eliminate errors on the Twitch Service; however we do not warrant that any Ancillary Products and Services or description, photograph, pricing or other information of a product, service or digital content is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of an error, whether on the Twitch Service, in an order confirmation, in processing an order, delivering an Ancillary Product or Service or otherwise, we reserve the right to correct such error and revise your order accordingly if necessary (including charging the correct price) or to cancel the order and refund any amount charged. In addition, we may, in lieu of a refund as provided in this paragraph, opt to provide you with a service credit, with a value equal to the amount charged to your payment method. Twitch reserves the right to determine and modify from time to time the exact nature of any such service credit, including conversion into one or more different types of Ancillary Products and Services credits. Your sole remedy in the event of such error is to cancel your order and obtain a refund or credit as set forth above.
>
> #### Taxes

> You are responsible for any applicable national, state or local sales or use taxes, value added taxes ("VAT") or similar taxes or fees payable in connection with your purchase of any products, services, or digital content for yourself or as a gift. As the purchaser of a subscription or digital good for another party as a gift, taxes or other fees on that transaction will be calculated based on your country of residence. If you do not pay such sales or other tax or fee on a transaction, you will be responsible for such taxes or fees in the event that they are later determined to be payable on such sale, and Twitch reserves the right to collect such taxes or other fees from you at any time.

> PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH TWITCH AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM TWITCH.
>
> You and Twitch agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms of Sale or your use of the Twitch Service, except that you and Twitch are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL. You and Twitch agree that you will notify each other in writing of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises. Notice to Twitch shall be sent to Twitch Interactive, Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 350 Bush Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94104.

Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Any dispute between the parties will be governed by this Agreement and the laws of the State of California and applicable United States law, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Whether the dispute is heard in arbitration or in court, you and Twitch will not commence against the other a class action, class arbitration or other representative action or proceeding.

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any provision of these Terms of Sale shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms of Sale and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
